## General info

In software engineering, the **singleton pattern** is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a singular instance. One of the well-known _"Gang of Four"_ design patterns, which describes how to solve recurring problems in object-oriented software, the pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

More specifically, the **singleton pattern** allows objects to:

* Ensure they only have one instance
* Provide easy access to that instance
* Control their instantiation (for example, hiding the constructors of a class)
* The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.
