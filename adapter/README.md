## General info

_In software engineering_, the **adapter pattern** is a software design pattern (also known as **wrapper**, an alternative naming shared with the decorator pattern) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

An example is an **adapter** that converts the interface of a _Document Object Model_ of an _XML_ document into a tree structure that can be displayed.
