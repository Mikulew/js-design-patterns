## General info

In _object-oriented programming_, the **decorator pattern** is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual **object**, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other instances of the same **class**. The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the **Single Responsibility Principle**, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern as well as to the **Open-Closed Principle**, by allowing the functionality of a class to be extended without being modified. **Decorator** use can be more efficient than subclassing, because an object's behavior can be augmented without defining an entirely new object.
