## General info

In software engineering, a **software design pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized **best practices** that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

**Object-oriented design patterns** typically show **relationships** and **interactions** between **classes** or **objects**, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for **functional programming** languages. Some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.
